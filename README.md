# 🚀 Space Tourism API

This is a simple REST API built with **Node.js** and **Express**. It serves data for a space exploration platform, including information about planetary destinations, crew members, and space flight technology.

This is data from [FE Mentor Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3): 
I'm practicing React Router v7 & fetching data for different routes.

## 🛠 Features
- **Fast & Lightweight:** Built with Express.js.
- **Categorized Endpoints:** Access specific data for destinations, crew, or tech.
- **CORS Enabled:** Ready to be consumed by frontend frameworks like React, Vue, or Next.js.
